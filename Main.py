# Lets Start

# 1st step : we need to take the input from user

input = str(input("Enter A Phrase :"))

# 2nd step : now we need to split the phrase / sentence

text = input.split()
acronym = " "

# now let's start the for loop

for i in text:  # (:) this symbol is called as indentation
    acronym = acronym + str(i[0]).upper()

    # here the upper() function is used to get the Upper Case Letters that we give

# now let's print the acronym

print(acronym)

# now let's run the code and check

# so now its asking to enter a phrase lets enter it  , so I have given it Machine Learning so we will get
# output as ML , LET'S SEE , So YESS!! We got it
